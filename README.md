# Realized Volatility Prediction

## Overview

This project explores the intricacies of financial market volatility, focusing on the prediction of short-term fluctuations in stock prices. By developing robust models to forecast volatility over brief 10-minute intervals, our work aims to enhance the precision of pricing options and other financial derivatives.

## Objective

Our primary goal is to construct and refine models that predict short-term stock volatility across a broad spectrum of industries. These predictions are vital for understanding price movements and optimizing financial strategies in the dynamic stock market.

## Evaluation Metric

The performance of our models is assessed using the **Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE)**, which gauges the accuracy of the volatility forecasts by measuring the percentage deviation from actual observed values.

## Key Results

- **Model RMSPE**: `0.341`

The model achieved an RMSPE of 0.341, demonstrating a substantial level of accuracy in forecasting short-term stock volatility. This result is a testament to the model's effectiveness in capturing rapid market fluctuations.

## Challenges and Insights

- **Forecasting Short-Term Volatility**: Predicting volatility over such short timeframes poses significant challenges, requiring sophisticated techniques and high-frequency data to capture market dynamics effectively.

- **Impact on Financial Products**: Accurate volatility predictions play a crucial role in the pricing and valuation of options and other financial instruments. The insights derived from this project are instrumental in refining financial decision-making processes.

## Project Highlights

- **Diverse Data Sources**: Integrated data from a variety of stock sectors to ensure comprehensive model training and evaluation.
- **Advanced Modeling Techniques**: Applied cutting-edge methodologies to enhance the accuracy and reliability of volatility forecasts.
- **Financial Relevance**: Provided actionable insights that can directly influence option pricing and financial market strategies.
